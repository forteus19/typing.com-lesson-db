Dear Sirs,
I have just purchased an HP 2200x computer system and would like to order two boxes of diskettes for it. This system uses 5 1/4 inch, hard-sectored, ten-sector, single-sided, single-density diskettes. Enclosed is my check for 45.00. Please rush this order as I cannot use my system before they arrive.
