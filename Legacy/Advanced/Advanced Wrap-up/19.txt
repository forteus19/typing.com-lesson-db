I am leaving a hundred matters. He has my opinion on each. Tell him the minutes of the meeting of the members are on my table. Tell him I haven't an invoice but instead have an early bill for our new machine parts. He may mention this item to the manager, as he has neither its history nor my letters of inquiry. I find nothing else to include. We shall miss you greatly, and we shall be looking for you at our new home.
