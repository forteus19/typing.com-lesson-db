@DalaiLama. "What is important is not so much how long you live as whether you live a meaningful life. This doesn't mean accumulating money and fame, but being of service to your fellow human beings. It means helping others if you can, but even if you can't do that, at least not harming them." Facebook, 30 Dec. 2019, www.facebook.com/DalaiLama/posts/10156924 578392616.
