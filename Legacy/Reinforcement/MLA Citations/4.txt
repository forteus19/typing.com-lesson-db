To do an in-text citation, you need the author's name and the page number where the information is located. If the source doesn't have page numbers (or numbered paragraphs, sections, or chapters), use only the author's name. The in-text citation should go at the end of the sentence, right before the punctuation mark. Next are some examples of how to quote sources using MLA format.
